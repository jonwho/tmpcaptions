So what happened?

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.654 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:45%
Last night, at the

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.654 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
anticlimactic apocalypse party.

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:55.655 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
You were there.

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:68%
I was a little preoccupied,

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:57.790 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
the world was ending.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.059 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
<i>Ian just proposed, Cal,</i>

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.195 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:80%
marriage, in front of everybody.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.596 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:15%
<i>What?!</i>

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:05.598 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:43%
What did you say?

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:08.201 align:middle line:69% position:48% size:68%
<i>What was I supposed to say?</i>

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:08.201 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
<i>He had a ring.</i>

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.069 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Oh, my God, can I see it?

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:11.604 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:30%
No, I am not

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:11.604 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
wearing it for chrissake,

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:13.473 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I've been dodging him all day!

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:16.042 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:73%
I don't even know what to do.

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:16.042 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
Isn't that why you called?

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:18.044 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:33%
No, actually.

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:21.581 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:53%
<i>Where's Thom, anyway?</i>

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:31.524 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
Let's get drunk.

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:35.628 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:03%
â™ª

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.637 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:38%
Like, fuck him,

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.637 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
like, seriously fuck him.

00:06:45.271 --> 00:06:46.506 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
Is this straight whiskey?

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.142 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:33%
I'm hungover.

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:50.243 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
All right.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.149 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
Can I tell you a secret?

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:57.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
I never liked him anyway.

00:06:57.416 --> 00:06:58.551 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:33%
Not a secret.

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.019 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:45%
I want you to meet

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:00.019 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
my friend Christopher.

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:01.354 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
I've met Christopher.

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:03.222 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:25%
You've not

00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:03.222 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
given him a chance.

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:05.224 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:53%
You've gotta take him

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:05.224 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:43%
for a test drive.

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:08.261 align:middle line:69% position:48% size:48%
We've been together

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:08.261 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:38%
for four years.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.263 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
We have a cat.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.132 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:30%
In gay terms

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.132 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
that's like, 2.8 kids.

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:15.268 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I think that's your problem.

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.669 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:40%
- What? The cat?

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.669 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:18%
- Yeah.

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.271 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
No. You're gay, right?

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.272 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
On the weekends.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.541 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:43%
Yes, you are gay,

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:21.541 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
gay, gay, gay, gay.

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:23.276 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:25%
So listen,

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:23.276 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:55%
this is actually good.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.546 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:73%
It means that you do not have

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.546 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
to proscribe to all of these,

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:31.684 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:78%
like, heteronormative standards

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:31.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
and, like, bullshit mores

00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:33.686 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
and puritanical commitments.

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:36.255 align:middle line:69% position:55% size:73%
It is a little late for that,

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:36.255 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
don't you think?

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.394 align:middle line:69% position:55% size:73%
Besides, if I give up on this

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.394 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
relationship, Chick-Fil-A wins.

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:45.531 align:middle line:69% position:48% size:53%
Yeah, but how can you

00:07:43.429 --> 00:07:45.531 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
possibly trust him again?

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.034 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
Maybe I can't.

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:52.705 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:33%
Maybe that...

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:52.705 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
just has to be okay.

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:57.443 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:43%
Wow, love is dead

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:57.443 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
because you just killed it.

00:07:58.344 --> 00:07:59.445 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:13%
Bang.

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:02.281 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
Maybe I should get married.

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:03.416 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:13%
What?

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:06.152 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:18%
I'm 25,

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:06.152 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
I'm not getting any younger.

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.554 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:75%
I mean, what if I want to have

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.554 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
kids or something like that?

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:09.689 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
You hate kids.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.424 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:73%
Eh, but what if I want them?!

00:08:11.424 --> 00:08:13.125 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:58%
You're gonna hate them.

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:16.262 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:78%
I'm gonna go break up with Ian.

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.665 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:75%
Maybe you should give yourself

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.665 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:70%
the night to think about it.

00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:22.001 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
That's a terrible idea.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.037 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:53%
Do ya got any Ambien?

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:26.172 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:20%
[laughs]

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.573 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:33%
- Thom might?

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.573 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:25%
- Mmm-hmm.

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:29.208 align:middle line:69% position:55% size:73%
- Let's get it, let's get it.

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:29.208 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
- Alright.

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:30.476 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
All right, this time.

00:08:30.476 --> 00:08:31.711 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
This one time.

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.618 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:50%
You sure you're okay

00:08:36.616 --> 00:08:38.618 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
to walk home like this?

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:40.219 align:middle line:79% position:55% size:73%
Yeah, I do this all the time.

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:41.320 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
It's really fun for me.

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:46.092 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:70%
Hey, you sure you don't want

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:46.092 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
to stay at my place tonight?

00:08:46.092 --> 00:08:47.493 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
I am sure, thank you.

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:49.228 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:65%
Well, if you need anything

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:49.228 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
you call me, okay?

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:50.196 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:18%
I will.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.597 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:10%
Bye.

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:54.500 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:28%
I love you.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.735 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
You're gonna be okay.

00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:58.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:28%
I love you.

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:09.682 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:13%
Ah...

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:21.594 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:13%
Fuck.

00:09:23.362 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:13%
Yeah.

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:28.467 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
I'm fucked up.

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:31.504 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:18%
Me too.

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:34.106 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:63%
No, I mean I'm fucking...

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:35.241 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
fucked up.

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.978 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:35%
I'm fucking...

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:40.346 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
fucked in the head.

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:47.353 align:middle line:69% position:45% size:60%
Maybe you should ease up

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:47.353 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
on this stuff for a bit.

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
I can't do this anymore.

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:53.693 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:48%
Well, I'm not gonna

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:53.693 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
peer pressure you.

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:54.994 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
You don't understand.

00:09:56.295 --> 00:09:58.397 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:30%
No, I don't.

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:65%
You make me feel, amazing.

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:08.007 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:58%
You don't hate my guts.

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:10.676 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:48%
You don't judge me.

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:18.684 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:30%
No, I don't.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.022 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
You don't know me.

00:10:25.057 --> 00:10:26.425 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:50%
I'm a piece of shit.

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:30.429 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:25%
I'm sorry.

00:10:32.198 --> 00:10:35.234 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
I really like you, Jeremy.

00:10:35.234 --> 00:10:38.204 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
But I can't see you anymore.

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:43.242 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:38%
And that's what

00:10:39.372 --> 00:10:43.242 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
I came here to tell you,

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:46.078 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:53%
however circuitously.

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:50.082 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:18%
[sighs]

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.653 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:25%
I'm sorry.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.653 align:middle line:79% position:48% size:58%
Um, I should go change.

00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:58.257 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:30%
I'm gonna...

00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:58.257 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:75%
I'm gonna get dressed outside.

00:10:58.257 --> 00:10:59.225 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:13%
Wait.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:01.027 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:13%
Wait.

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:40%
It's over, okay?

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.702 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:33%
No, it isn't.

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:16.242 align:middle line:69% position:50% size:33%
I want to get

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:16.242 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:45%
to know you, Thom.
